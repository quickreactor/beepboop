## Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of

response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
